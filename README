"docker-compose up" to start the dev server

If you want to work on the frontend, "npm run dev" or "npm run build" will run
webpack once, and "npm run watch" will make webpack run whenever something changes.

In general, my goal was to use the technologies that I would have chosen in a larger app, even if they are a bit overkill here.  The frontend is rather barebones, because it didn't seem like the point of the project.
